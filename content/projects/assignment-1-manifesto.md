title: "Manifesto"
---

This assignment was adapted from and inspired by **[Salome Asega](https://twitter.com/suhlomay)** and Yotam Mann.

All artists have an implicit or explicit “manifesto” of design values/ideas/axioms that, sometimes loosely, sometimes closely, help guide and direct their work. Having such principles/axioms helps artists keep their voice; helps them resist pressures \(primarily commercial\); gives their work a more critical edge. This exercise is designed for beginning developing an artist manifesto that’s not necessarily rooted in your current practice but somewhat related to how you see yourselves in, say, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 40 years.

For this assignment, write 3-5 paragraphs on some principles and ideas that motivate and direct your practice. This can be difficult, but clarifying your thoughts in writing will help you compose and create with intention and purpose throughout the semester.

Post your manifesto D2L before next week.
