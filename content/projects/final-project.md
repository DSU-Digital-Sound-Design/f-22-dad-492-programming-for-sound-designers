title: "Final Project"
---

Your final project will be a performable instrument or interactive musical experience. You will use Tone.js for sound and p5.js for the GUI and possible extra visuals.

Projects should include the following:

## Implementation

### Tone.js

- Synthesized sound with one of the instruments
- Sampled sound with Tone.Player
- At least two effects
- Some type of sequencing, using Loop, Part, Pattern, Sequence, or ToneEvent

### p5.js

- A clear graphical user interface with
- Labeled controls
- Some text explaining how to use the project if necessary

## Written response

Write three to five paragraphs describing your project. Talk about your design choices and goals for the project. Did you meet those goals? What challenges did you run into that hindered you in the process?

Post this description with your final project in your GitHub project as a ReadMe.

## Presentation

During presentations you will spend a minute or two describing the project your intentions for creating it. After that your classmates will preform or play with your project. The instrument's interface and design must be intuitive enough for someone else to learn it's function in a short amount of time. If you classmates can't figure out how your project works it will negatively effect your grade.

## Deployment

Your project will be deployed to the web using GitHub and GitHub pages. We'll talk about how to do with in class. In this GitHub project you'll add the Read ME with your project description and a link to a working version of the project.
