title: "Project 1: Sampler Playback"
---

For this assignment, the goal is to create a sketch that does the following:

- loads at least 8 unique sounds into the sketch with Tone.Players()
- playback of the sounds can be triggered by clicking a button
- at least 4 audio effects are applied to the sounds in sequence
- Each audio effect can be altered by a slider

Remember the goal is to be able to trigger multiple sound effects using Tone.Players(), and apply an effect ot them with the use of on-screen sliders. If you felt that using buttons was simple, try and map the sound playback to various keyboard buttons as well.

Use [this as a template](https://codesandbox.io/s/tone-p5-template-jo1tgr) if needed.

Create a score and realize it using your sampler instrument. Your realization should be around 1 minute in length.

Items to Submit:

- the CodeSandbox link to your project
- the score
- screen recording of your score realization
