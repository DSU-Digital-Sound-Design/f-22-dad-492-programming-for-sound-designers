title: "Project 1: Sampler Playback"
---

For this assignment, the goal is to create a sketch that does the following:

- loads at least 8 unique sounds into the sketch with Tone.Players()
- playback of the sounds can be triggered by clicking a button
- at least 4 audio effects are applied to the sounds in sequence
- Each audio effect can be altered by a slider

Remember the goal is to be able to trigger multiple sound effects using Tone.Players(), and apply an effect ot them with the use of on-screen sliders. If you felt that using buttons was simple, try and map the sound playback to various keyboard buttons as well.

Use [this as a template](https://codesandbox.io/s/tone-p5-template-jo1tgr) if needed.

Create a piece of music using your sampler instrument. Your realization should be around 1 minute in length.

Items to Submit:

- the CodeSandbox link to your project
- screen recording of your performance
- a paragraph about the form of the piece and how you realized it with your instrument. What sorts of decisions did you make with your interface in order to create the piece that you wanted?
