title: "Project 2: Synth from scratch"
---

Recreate the MonoSynth instrument from Sources and Components. The user should have control over the sound of the synthesizer. For example the ability to choose different oscillator types, filter types, filter cutoff and envelope ADSR. The user should also be able to choose between presets. When the user picks a preset, the user interface should reflect those changes in parameters.
