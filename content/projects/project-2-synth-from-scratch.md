title: "Project 2: Synth from scratch"
---

Recreate the MonoSynth instrument from Sources and Components. The user should have control over the sound of the synthesizer. For example the ability to choose different oscillator types, filter types, filter cutoff and envelope ADSR. The user should also be able to choose between presets. When the user picks a preset, the user interface should reflect those changes in parameters.

To make your MonoSynth use the following diagram:

Make sure to use the correct envelope type for the amplitude and frequency envelopes.

Use the [AudioKeys](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys) library to turn your computer keyboard into a musical keyboard. Use the example from the last time we used AudioKeys to see how to add it to your project.

We will build our synthesizer modeled off of the free [TAL-NoiseMaker](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-noisemaker).

Allow the user to change the ADSR of the amplitude and filter envelopes.

Make it look nice!

Here is a working example of the project:
