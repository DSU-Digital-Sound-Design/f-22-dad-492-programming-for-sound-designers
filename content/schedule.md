<!--

Week 10 - 12 - sequencing/tuning/matching sound to visuals

Next Project: score a p5.js animation
 -->

<!--

Synth from scratch DUE

- [Process Music](https://tambien.github.io/InteractiveMusic/module/process_music) - music created from a series of instructions
- [Randomization and patterns](https://tambien.github.io/InteractiveMusic/module/randomization)

- **create score** - Create a hand-drawn or computer-generated graphical score. This doesn't need to be artistic, just something that will inspire a piece of music for a project later in the semester.
- **Project 3 - [Realize](https://tambien.github.io/InteractiveMusic/assignment/midterm_1) your score as code** - take part of [PDM scoring an image](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/3_audio/2_synthsandmusic/4_lesson_4/)

# Week 6 (9/26) - Process and generative music, More musical complexity

- Rhythm / Scales / Tuning / - [slides](https://lsu-pdm-2021.netlify.com/week_4_t/_static/#/)
- More patterns with [total-serialism](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism)
- Sound an animation - we'll go through the tricks of adding sound to looping structures. See [HackPact](https://github.com/stc/HackPact) for examples.
- **Assignment 4 - Midterm** - Score a p5.js sketch using everything you've learned so far. Cool p5.js sketches can be found at [Open Processing](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending). Also, see the Generative Design book for great sketches. Also, see the [nature of code](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js).
- Other ideas: [Generative Landscape 1](https://editor.p5js.org/EdCavett/full/-fcf1cLwf), [Generative Landscape 2](https://editor.p5js.org/ndeji69/sketches/rqMKO4jr1)

# Week 7 (10/3) - Sonification

Assignment 3 DUE

- Dealing with real-time data sources
- Sonification - **Assignment 5** - sonify any real-time data from the web. Ex: [ISS Location](https://github.com/CodeAsCreativeMedium/exercises/tree/main/17_sound/09_data_sonification). See Measuring Device from CaCM pg 110 for more sensor-based inspiration. You could also sonify time-related data. See [ClockWork](https://clockwork.scholarslab.org/) for examples on that. This project is also inspired by the following:
- Clock project from code as creative medium (pg 30).
- Data Self-Portrait (pg 62) - instead of sonifying a source of data you find, make your data source that represents some aspect of your life.
