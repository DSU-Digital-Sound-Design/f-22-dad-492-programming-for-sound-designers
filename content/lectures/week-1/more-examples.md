### Tracking

#### [Firewall - Aaron Sherwood, Mike Allison](https://vimeo.com/54882144)

Great example of mapping pressure and dynamics in an interesting way.

#### [Trechery Of Sanctuary - Chris Milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2kZdl8hs_s)

Chris Milk's piece effectively employs sound to heighten the experience of the piece. The forceful sound of the flapping wings slows the user down and makes them embody the bird.

### Instrument

#### [Reactable - Sergi Jordà, Marcos Alonso, Martin Kaltenbrunner and Günter Geiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgy1S8qymx0)

A table with a camera underneath tracks fiducial markers on blocks. The placement and rotation of the blocks controls music music or sound effects.

#### [Playing the Building - David Byrne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gea9SYUdJeY)

Byrne connected a piano keyboard to trigger motors and actuators around the building. Great use of space and materials.

### Environmental

#### [Subway Symphony - James Murphy](http://www.subwaysymphony.org/)

A proposed project which puts a lot of musical attention to the sound design of the New York Subway system.

#### [Strings - Monica Bate, Johann Diedrick, Luisa Pereira Hors](https://vimeo.com/84474194)

Very architecturally striking design. Maps string plucks / stretches to samples and synthesis.

#### [21 Balançoires (21 Swings) - Daily tous les jours](https://vimeo.com/40980676)

Playful public installation where swinging on swings generates music. Clear mapping and lots of variation in rhythm and melody.

#### [Piano Stairs - Remo Saraceni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOVHNGeDxKE)

Not great sound design / composition (IMO), but very clear mapping.

#### [Voice Array - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer](http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/voice-array-by-rafael-lozanohemmer)

Participants record a short audio segment which is stored for later listeners.

#### [Global String by Atau Tanaka (2000)](https://vimeo.com/46800992)

Connected via the Internet. real time sound synthesis.

What are the affordances/constraints that an art has versus a web based project?
